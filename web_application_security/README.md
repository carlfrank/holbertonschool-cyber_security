## 1. How the Web Works
- The web is a system of interlinked resources accessed via the Internet.
- **Key Components:**
  - **Client (Browser):** Sends requests using HTTP/HTTPS.
  - **Server:** Responds to client requests with resources like HTML, CSS, or JS.
  - **DNS:** Translates domain names (e.g., `google.com`) into IP addresses.
- **Process:**
  1. User enters a URL in the browser.
  2. Browser sends an HTTP request to the server.
  3. Server processes the request and sends a response.
  4. Browser renders the response for the user.

## 3. Web 1.0 vs Web 2.0 vs Web 3.0
- **Web 1.0:** Static, read-only websites (1990s).
  - Focus: Sharing information (e.g., blogs, forums).
- **Web 2.0:** Dynamic, user-interactive websites (2000s).
  - Focus: User-generated content, social interaction (e.g., Facebook, YouTube).
- **Web 3.0:** Decentralized and intelligent web (current era).
  - Focus: Blockchain, AI, and semantic web (e.g., cryptocurrency, NFTs).

## 4. PWA - Progressive Web Applications
- **Definition:** Web applications that behave like native mobile apps.
- **Key Features:**
  - Installable on home screens.
  - Offline functionality (via Service Workers).
  - Responsive design.
  - Fast and reliable performance.
- **Examples:** Twitter Lite, Starbucks PWA.

## 5. How Does the Front-End Communicate with the Back-End?
- **Front-End:** User-facing part (HTML, CSS, JS).
- **Back-End:** Server-side logic and data processing (e.g., Python, Node.js).
- **Communication Methods:**
  - **HTTP/HTTPS Protocols** (e.g., using REST APIs or GraphQL).
  - **AJAX or Fetch API** for asynchronous requests.
  - **Data Formats:** JSON or XML.

## 6. Stateful vs Stateless: What’s the Difference?
- **Stateful:**
  - Server retains client information (state) across requests.
  - Example: Online banking sessions.
- **Stateless:**
  - Server treats each request independently with no memory of prior interactions.
  - Example: HTTP, DNS.

---

## 7. Structured vs Unstructured: What’s the Difference?
- **Structured Data:**
  - Organized into fixed fields or formats (e.g., databases).
  - **Examples:** Names, dates, addresses.
- **Unstructured Data:**
  - No predefined format or organization.
  - **Examples:** Text, images, IoT sensor data.

## 8. Web Application Security Risks
- **Common Risks:**
  - **SQL Injection (SQLi):** Malicious SQL queries.
  - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts.
  - **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Forcing users to perform unwanted actions.
  - **Broken Authentication:** Weak login mechanisms.
  - **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** Exposing sensitive data via improper authorization.
- Refer to **OWASP Top 10** for an in-depth understanding.

## 9. Bug Bounty Programs
- **Definition:** Programs that reward individuals for identifying and reporting security vulnerabilities.
- **Examples:** Google Vulnerability Reward Program, HackerOne, Bugcrowd.
- **Steps:**
  1. Identify vulnerabilities ethically.
  2. Report findings to the organization.
  3. Receive rewards based on severity and impact.
