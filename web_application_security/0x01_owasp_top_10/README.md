## 🛡️ OWASP Top 10 Security Risks
Below is a summary of each OWASP Top 10 risk and its impact:

### 1️⃣ **Injection**
- Attackers inject **malicious input** (SQL, command, LDAP injection) to manipulate applications.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, system compromise.

### 2️⃣ **Broken Authentication**
- Weak authentication allows attackers to **bypass login security**.
- **Impact:** Account takeovers, credential stuffing attacks.

### 3️⃣ **Sensitive Data Exposure**
- Unencrypted or improperly handled data can be **stolen or intercepted**.
- **Impact:** Identity theft, financial fraud.

### 4️⃣ **Security Misconfiguration**
- Weak configurations (default credentials, unnecessary features) lead to vulnerabilities.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data breaches.

### 5️⃣ **XML External Entities (XXE)**
- Poorly configured XML parsers allow attackers to read system files or make server-side requests.
- **Impact:** Data exfiltration, denial-of-service.

### 6️⃣ **Broken Access Control**
- Users gain **unauthorized access** to data or functionalities.
- **Impact:** Data manipulation, privilege escalation.

### 7️⃣ **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- Malicious scripts run in user browsers.
- **Impact:** Session hijacking, credential theft.

### 8️⃣ **Insecure Deserialization**
- Attackers exploit **poorly handled serialized data**.
- **Impact:** Remote code execution, application compromise.

### 9️⃣ **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**
- Outdated libraries, frameworks, or dependencies introduce security flaws.
- **Impact:** System takeover, malware injection.

### 🔟 **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring**
- Lack of proper logging makes it hard to detect and respond to attacks.
- **Impact:** Unnoticed breaches, prolonged data theft.

## 🛠️ **How to Secure Applications**
1. **Use parameterized queries** to prevent SQL Injection.
2. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** to prevent broken authentication.
3. **Encrypt sensitive data** using strong cryptographic standards.
4. **Apply security patches** and remove **default credentials**.
5. **Harden server configurations** by disabling unnecessary features.
6. **Sanitize all user inputs** to prevent XSS and injection attacks.
7. **Use secure deserialization techniques** to avoid remote code execution.
8. **Regularly update and audit third-party components**.
9. **Monitor logs and implement real-time alerts**.
10. **Secure API endpoints** with authentication and rate limiting.
