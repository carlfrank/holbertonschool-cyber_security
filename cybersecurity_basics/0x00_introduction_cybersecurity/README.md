### **Learning Objectives**

**1. What is Cybersecurity?**  
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, unauthorized access, and damage.

**2. What are the core principles of cybersecurity? (CIA Triad)**  
The CIA Triad consists of Confidentiality (protecting data access), Integrity (ensuring data accuracy), and Availability (maintaining system uptime).

**3. How does encryption contribute to security?**  
Encryption transforms data into unreadable formats for unauthorized users, ensuring secure communication and data storage.

**4. What is risk management in cybersecurity?**  
Risk management involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential threats to minimize security vulnerabilities.

**5. What are the different types of cybersecurity threats?**  
Cybersecurity threats include malware, phishing, ransomware, denial of service (DoS), insider threats, and advanced persistent threats (APTs).

**6. What is the difference between a virus and a worm?**  
A virus attaches to files and requires user action to spread, while a worm is standalone and spreads automatically through networks.

**7. What is social engineering in the context of security?**  
Social engineering manipulates people into divulging sensitive information through deception, often bypassing technical security.

**8. What are the key components of an information security program?**  
Key components include risk management, access control, incident response, security policies, training, and regular audits.

**9. How do security policies and frameworks contribute to an organizationâ€™s security posture?**  
They establish clear guidelines and best practices, aligning operations with industry standards to reduce vulnerabilities.

**10. What is the purpose of the OWASP Top Ten?**  
The OWASP Top Ten identifies the most critical web application security risks to help organizations mitigate vulnerabilities.

**11. What is the role of access control in cybersecurity?**  
Access control ensures that only authorized users can access specific data, systems, or resources, reducing risk.

**12. How does multi-factor authentication enhance security?**  
Multi-factor authentication requires multiple verification methods, making it harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access.

**13. What are the common methods for securing a network?**  
Common methods include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, encryption, secure protocols, and regular updates.
